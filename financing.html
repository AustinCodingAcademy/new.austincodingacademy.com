      Other Funding Options
    </h2>
    <p class="my-4">
      Our students have been quite creative in their approach to financing their
      Austin Coding Academy education. Since we are the most affordable coding
      school in town, students are often able to cover the cost of tuition on
      their own, perhaps with some of the following supplements:
    </p>

    <p>
      <span class="font-weight-bold">Companies:</span> <br />
      Often, companies have a Professional Development program. We highly
      recommend that you approach your current employer to see if they would be
      able to cover all or some of your tuition. It’s a great way for your company
      to invest in your future AND increase your team’s value.
    </p>

    <p>
      <span class="font-weight-bold">Families:</span> <br />
      You can tell your parents or immediate family member that this is the last
      loan you’ll ever need because you’ll have a well-paying job after you
      complete a track at ACA.
    </p>

    <p>
      <span class="font-weight-bold">Private Financing:</span> <br />
      You’re always free to obtain a loan from any lender, not just our preferred
      vendors. We encourage you to be weary of lending startups who can sometimes
      take advantage of folks with poor credit. Please note that while other loan
      programs may be available to you, there is no agreement in place with Austin
      Coding Academy and these organizations.
