    Other Funding Options
  </h2>
  <p class="size-18 bottom-48">
    Our students have been quite creative in their approach to financing their
    Austin Coding Academy education. Since we are the most affordable coding
    school in town, students are often able to cover the cost of tuition on
    their own, perhaps with some of the following supplements:
  </p>

  <p class="size-18">
    <span class="font-weight-bold">Companies:</span> <br />
    Often, companies have a Professional Development program. We highly
    recommend that you approach your current employer to see if they would be
    able to cover all or some of your tuition. It’s a great way for your company
    to invest in your future AND increase your team’s value.
  </p>

  <p class="size-18">
    <span class="font-weight-bold">Families:</span> <br />
    You can tell your parents or immediate family member that this is the last
    loan you’ll ever need because you’ll have a well-paying job after you
    complete a track at ACA.
  </p>

  <p class="size-18">
    <span class="font-weight-bold">Private Financing:</span> <br />
    You’re always free to obtain a loan from any lender, not just our preferred
    vendors. We encourage you to be weary of lending startups who can sometimes
    take advantage of folks with poor credit. Please note that while other loan
    programs may be available to you, there is no agreement in place with Austin
    Coding Academy and these organizations.
