      cover:

      <li>Using a code editor (VScode) and code repository (Git)</li>
      <li>Deploying your website using Github</li>
      <li>Understanding how to add JavaScript to your website</li>
    </ul>

      After finishing the workshop, you’ll leave with your own live website and
      an understanding of the basics of web development. You’ll also be more
      than ready to join one of Austin Coding Academy’s Full Stack courses if
      you have your sights set on becoming a professional web developer!
