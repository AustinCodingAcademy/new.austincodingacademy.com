      Student Grievance Policy
    </h2>
    <p>
      It is the schoolâ€™s policy to resolve student grievances by working directly
      with the student, instructor, and other students if affected. Students with
      grievances should initially contact their instructor and articulate their
      grievance in writing. The instructor will notify the Director of Academics
      of student grievance and attempt to resolve the grievance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Attempts to resolve the grievance will be documented in email by the
      instructor and copied to the Director of Academics. If the instructor and
      student are unable to resolve the grievance, the grievance will be escalated
      to the Director of Academics. The Director of Academics will review prior
      resolution documentation, identify student concerns, needs, desires, and
      attempt to resolve the grievance with the student. The Director of Academics
      will document this process in writing in a student report file.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the Director of Academics is unable to resolve the student grievance, the
      Director of Academics will convene a committee of 2 student peers, 2 other
      certified instructors, and the Director of Academics to resolve the student
      grievance. The committee will review articulated grievance and documented
      attempts to resolve and form a majority decision for grievance resolution
      and present to student for approval. The Director of Academics will document
      their resolution in the student report file.
