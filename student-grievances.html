    Student Grievance Policy
  </h2>

  <p>
    It is the schoolâ€™s policy to resolve student grievances by working directly
    with the student, instructor, and other students if affected. Students with
    grievances should initially contact their instructor and articulate their
    grievance in writing. The instructor will notify the Director of Academics
    of student grievance and attempt to resolve the grievance.
  </p>

  <p>
    Attempts to resolve the grievance will be documented in email by the
    instructor and copied to the Director of Academics. If the instructor and
    student are unable to resolve the grievance, the grievance will be escalated
    to the Director of Academics. The Director of Academics will review prior
    resolution documentation, identify student concerns, needs, desires, and
    attempt to resolve the grievance with the student. The Director of Academics
    will document this process in writing in a student report file. If the
    Director of Academics is unable to resolve the student grievance, the
    Director of Academics will convene a committee of 2 student peers, 2 other
    certified instructors, and the Director of Academics to resolve the student
    grievance. The committee will review articulated grievance and documented
    attempts to resolve and form a majority decision for grievance resolution
    and present to student for approval. The Director of Academics will document
    their resolution in the student report file.
