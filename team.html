  - name: Chris Sica
    title: Co-Founder
    email: chris@austincodingacademy.com
    bio: "Chris and his co-founder, Luke Filipos, were frustrated with hiring a dev team to build an app for them. They decided they were going to learn how to code themselves so they could get an MVP up and running. When they noticed that most of the coding bootcamps meant quitting their day jobs and having to pay almost 20k up front, they decided there had to be a better way. Thus was born the first part time coding school in Austin."
