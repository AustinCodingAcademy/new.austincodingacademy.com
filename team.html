    email: dan@austincodingacademy.com
    bio: As a humble hustler, I&#8217;ve grown with Austin Coding Academy over the last
      three years holding several roles wherever I could add value to the school and
      to the students. I graduated with a Journalism BS from University of Richmond
      (go Spiders!), and got my professional start with sales and leadership. I&#8217;ve
      traveled coast-to-coast on my motorcycle several times, which led me to find a
      true home here in Austin in 2014. I&#8217;m all about connecting, so say hello!

    bio: I&#8217;m a graphic designer from Lebanon. I moved here 9 years ago for a new

      not at work, I&#8217;m usually at one of Austin&#8217;s many amazing coffee shops,
      making art or planning my next trip or both. Creating beautiful things is my passion.
      Being at ACA allows me to do what I love everyday, surrounded by the best team.
