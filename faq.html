    title: Tuition Questions
    faqs:
    - question: How much is tuition?
      answer: Each 8-week class is $2,990, and each track consists of 4 classes.
    - question: What if I really want to sign up but I can’t afford it?
      answer: We encourage you to check with your current employer to see if they’d
        be willing to assist with the costs. Also, we partner with a reputable organization
        for financing. <a href="https://austincodingacademy.com/financing/">Skills
        Fund</a> is simple to apply for, and offers the same great rate for every
        student approved for financing.
    - question: Do you offer scholarships?
      answer: Yes! Make sure you’re signed up for our blog and are subscribed to our
        newsletter to learn about these opportunities as they arise. Also note that
        if you’re a driver for Lyft, we offer tuition discounts - <a href="https://sites.google.com/lyft.com/lyftaustinonboarding/driver-deals/education">click

      answer: We accept credit cards and checks.
    - question: Can I just take a single course?
      answer: Yes, absolutely. If you’re a novice, you’d have to take Web 101 first.
        If you’re already a developer, it’s possible you could test out of Web 101
        and start in a more advanced class. You’ll go through the same application
        process either way and we’ll get all the details we need to get you in the
        right class during our interview call, so don’t hesitate &#8208; <a href="/apply">apply
        now!</a>
    - question: Do I have to take each course consecutively?
      answer: If you apply and register for the Full Track, you’ll take each course
        consecutively. If you’re already a developer interested in individual courses,
        it’s possible you could test into specific classes. Either way, you’ll need
        to go through the application process, and we’ll get all the details we need
        to get you into the right class during our interview call, so we encourage
        you to go ahead and <a href="/apply">apply now!</a>
