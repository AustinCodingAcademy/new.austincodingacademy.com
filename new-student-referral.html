    Students at Austin Coding Academy come from all walks of life, but they each share one common trait; every ACA student is committed to learning and improving, whether they’re hoping to launch a more rewarding career, adding a new skill to their repertoire, or transforming a great idea into a new company. After our students complete ACA and witness first-hand the transformative nature of our school, they’re so often shouting our praises from the rooftop. As a way of saying thanks for all of that ACA love, we’re offering a special Referral Program for our November and January cohorts!

      How Does It Work?
    </h2>
  </div>
  <p class="mt-3">
    Austin Coding Academy’s referral process is simple. Current students, graduates, and instructors who want to share the benefits of learning with ACA will be rewarded for growing the community. ACA will be awarding referral bonuses to both current students, grads, and instructors who refer new students, and to referred students who enroll in classes. Both the new student and the referring student, graduate, or instructor will receive a $100 for helping build our community. When a referred student submits an application they’ll select either "ACA faculty / staff" or "ACA student / alumni" in the "How did you hear about us?" field. Be sure to mention who you were referred by in your application interview. Once the new student has completed three weeks of their course, both the studente and the referrer will receive their reward... Easy!
