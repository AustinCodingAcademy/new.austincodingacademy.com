blurb: "I love to learn and help others learn.  With a background in psychology and UX design, and just over a year of programming experience under my belt, I'm eager to join a startup determined to make the world a better place with the help of code!  I'm deeply analytical, curious, and I love a challenging problem and room for continual growth which were huge factors in my falling in love with programming."
