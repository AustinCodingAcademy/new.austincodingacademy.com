  - name: Your Movie Database
    desc: "YMDb is a cinephile hobbyist site for people that love making lists, film discussion, and film exploration. The site is meant to be a minimalist competitor to
      sites like Mubi and Letterboxd that appeals to a nerdier audience. The purpose is to allow people to state their movie preferences through their Top Movie List while giving them the opportunity to compare their taste in movies to other members of the YMDb community. The site incentivizes list making and film discussion by utilizing well-thought out limitations that make users more deliberate in how they chose films for their one and only list, which they can name and describe in the description section however they like. There will be a YMDb Top Movies List that aggragates film rankings from all user lists to make an overall YMDb community ranking, similar to what rateyourmusic.com has. The average ranking of films will also be viewable from their page as well as the rank in the most recent user lists the film was added to."
