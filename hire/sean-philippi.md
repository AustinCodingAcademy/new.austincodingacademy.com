    desc: "YMDB is a cinephile hobbyist site for people that love making lists, film discussion, and film exploration. The site is meant to be a minimalist competitor to
      sites like Mubi and Letterboxd that appeals to a nerdier audience and that is specifically tailored towards list making and film discussion. The site will have
      well-thought out limitations that make users more deliberate in how they chose films for their one and only list, which they can name and describe in the
      description   section however they like. The site will encourage users to make a list of favorite films, not themed or best-of-decade lists and there will be a YMDB
      top films list   that aggragates film rankings from all user lists to make an overall YMDB community ranking, similar to what rateyourmusic.com has."
